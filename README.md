# fantasy-football-tools

Collection of scripts for analyzing a fantasy football league on Fleaflicker

node version: 16.13.0

Technical TODO
- add eslint
- add a frontend with React or Vue (or experiment with both)
- mess around with deno
- add a real backend (try fastify?)
- try out some different databases

Feature TODO
- Team value analysis
- 538/NYT-like UI to analyze individual game outcomes (i.e. select a result for a specific game and see how odds change)
- build week-by-week team level projections based on some projections API (ESPN? Sleeper?)
- Historic win-loss records and scoring records
